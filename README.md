# Java-Uninstaller-Macos
A script that will uninstall Java enough to easily downgrade. Should allow you easily to downgrade java 9-12 to 8 to use programs that don't support the newer versions. 

Instructions:
1. Run "uninstall java.command"
2. Type in an administrator password
(That's all if you are just removing java)
3. Download the older version of java you wish to use (if you are downgrading). Java 8 can be found here- https://java.com/en/download/mac_download.jsp
4. Restart your computer
