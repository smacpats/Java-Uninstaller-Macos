# Java-Uninstaller-Macos
On a Mac and want to uninstall java 9-12 to just get rid of it, or to downgrade to java 6-8 because of incompatible programs? Youâ€™ve came to the right place. I created this script after realizing how annoying installing removing java is without knowing the right commands, so this script will do it all for you. 
This will remove all versions of JRE and JDK installed on your computer. 

Instructions:
1. Run "uninstall java.command"
2. Type in an administrator password
(That's all if you are just removing java)
3. Download the older version of java you wish to use (if you are downgrading). Java 8 can be found here- https://java.com/en/download/mac_download.jsp
4. Restart your computer

(Tested on MacOS 10.14 Mojave)
